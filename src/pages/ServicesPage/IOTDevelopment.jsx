          IoT (Internet of Things) Development is the process of building
          interconnected devices that can communicate with each other and the
          cloud through the internet. IoT enables businesses and consumers to
          collect data, automate processes, and improve decision-making in
          various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and
          smart homes. By leveraging sensors, connectivity, and cloud platforms,
          IoT offers a transformative impact on operations and productivity.
          <br />
          <br />A key benefit of IoT development is the ability to gain
          real-time insights from data collected by connected devices. This
          enables businesses to optimize processes, reduce inefficiencies, and
          make data-driven decisions. Additionally, IoT allows for automation
          and control of devices remotely, which can improve convenience,
          safety, and overall user experience.
